This codebook is to summarize the variables used and created and is very much directly pulled from the following link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions#

The  most relevant information in the data frame is:
Activity - Sitting, Laying, Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs,etc.  This was a numeric variable initially that was translated to text per the assignment.
Subject - The subject number was the identifier for each participant and was also pulled in to the total data as an identifier
The other variables saved are the means or standard deviations pulled from the main data set.  For instance, the tBodyAcc-mean()-Y is the average of the body acceleration in the y direction.
The tBodyAcc-std()-Y is the standard deviation of the body acceleration in the y direction. This is available for all the additional values listed below:
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "tBodyAcc-std()-X" "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" "tGravityAcc-mean()-X" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z" "tGravityAcc-std()-X" "tGravityAcc-std()-Y" "tGravityAcc-std()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyGyro-mean()-X" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyro-std()-X" "tBodyGyro-std()-Y" "tBodyGyro-std()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyAccMag-mean()" "tBodyAccMag-std()" "tGravityAccMag-mean()" "tGravityAccMag-std()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "tBodyGyroMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroMag-std()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "fBodyAcc-mean()-X" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "fBodyAcc-std()-X" "fBodyAcc-std()-Y" "fBodyAcc-std()-Z" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyGyro-mean()-X" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "fBodyGyro-std()-X" "fBodyGyro-std()-Y" "fBodyGyro-std()-Z" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyAccMag-mean()" "fBodyAccMag-std()" "fBodyAccMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()"
